# Flux

### A project I created with a team of classmates and friends for Creative Labs, a CS project club at UCLA

![Flux Home Feed](./pictures/flux/flux_one.png)

## [flux.rip](https://flux.rip)

#### [Github link](https://github.com/UCLA-Creative-Labs/flux/wiki)

This social media website was intentionally designed to have poor UX (to teach others about why good UX is important!). You can do everything you can normally do on social media sites: friend people, upload posts, view others' posts, recieve notifications, and send messages, but everything comes with a twist. When you try logging in, slide the continue button all the way to the left, then manually drag the progress bar to 100%. This should get you to the main site where you'll see all other sorts of UX problems in store for you! Built using React and firebase.
