# Projects

# Flux

### A project I created with a team of classmates and friends for Creative Labs, a CS project club at UCLA

## [flux.rip](https://flux.rip)

#### [Github link](https://github.com/UCLA-Creative-Labs/flux/wiki)

This social media website was intentionally designed to have poor UX (to teach others about why good UX is important!). You can do everything you can normally do on social media sites: friend people, upload posts, view others' posts, recieve notifications, and send messages, but everything comes with a twist. When you try logging in, slide the continue button all the way to the left, then manually drag the progress bar to 100%. This should get you to the main site where you'll see all other sorts of UX problems in store for you! Built using React and firebase.

# CalSIM

### The project I interned for at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research during the spring, summer, and fall of 2019.

## [CalSIM documentation page](calsim.bitbucket.io)

I rehauled the entire documentation page for CalSIM, and created a bash script to easily update it. Built using Sphinx and bash.

# The Stack

### The data journalism section of the _Daily Bruin_, UCLA's student newspaper

## [UCLA Trash Breakdown](https://stack.dailybruin.com/2019/06/07/waste-audits/)

Analyzed how much students/faculty at UCLA compost and recycle vs. throw trash into the landfill bin. Includes an interactive game where you try to sort different types of trash into the correct waste bin. Built using flask, React, and d3.

## [Analysis of the _Daily Bruin_'s 2018 Fall Interns](https://stack.dailybruin.com/2018/12/10/2018db-recruitment/)

Looked at the accpetance rates and demographics of the _Daily Bruin_'s 2018 fall interns.
