<h4 id="github-link"><a href="https://github.com/UCLA-Creative-Labs/flux/wiki">Github link</a></h4>

<p>This social media website was intentionally designed to have poor UX (to teach others about why good UX is important!). You can do everything you can normally do on social media sites: friend people, upload posts, view others’ posts, recieve notifications, and send messages, but everything comes with a twist. When you try logging in, slide the continue button all the way to the left, then manually drag the progress bar to 100%. This should get you to the main site where you’ll see all other sorts of UX problems in store for you! Built using React and firebase.</p>

<h1 id="calsim">CalSIM</h1>

<h3 id="the-project-i-interned-for-at-the-ucla-center-for-health-policy-research-during-the-spring-summer-and-fall-of-2019">The project I interned for at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research during the spring, summer, and fall of 2019.</h3>

Includes an interactive game where you try to sort different types of trash into the correct waste bin. After you are done with the game, compare the number of tries you took with other people who played the game! Built using flask, React, and d3.</p>
