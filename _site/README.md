# Andrew's Personal Website

Welcome to my website!

Feel free to learn more [about me](about.md), check out my [projects](projects.md), see my [resume](resume.md), and/or [contact me](contact.md).

### About me

I'm Andrew Kan (yes Kan, not Can). I am a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) who is also interested in a statistics minor. I'm currently thinking about what I can learn more about the world and how I can share this with others. You should definitely check my about me for more though!
