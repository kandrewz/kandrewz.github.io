# About Me

I am a second-year CSE major at UCLA trying to switch into CS + statistics minor.
I love talking about and solving any type of problem (even non-tech related ones!), and my goal
is to create technological solutions that make people happy and/or informed.

## Interests

I am currently interested in all things CS (from operating systems to front-end/back-end to algorithms). Also want to explore stats and the ML/AI fields.

## Skills

- Fluent: Python, C++, git, React, Linux

- Semi-fluent: d3, Pandas, Numpy, Firebase

- Used: flask, Postman

## Non-professional Interests

- Running (currently training for a 1:30 half-marathon)
- Reading longforms (long journalism commentaries)
- League of Legends
- Slay the Spire
- Sudoku
- Psychological Manga (Monster, Oyasumi punpun, Berserk)
