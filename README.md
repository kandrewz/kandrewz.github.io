### About me

I'm Andrew Kan (pronounced Can). I am a fourth-year Computer Science and Engineering major and Statistics minor at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I'm currently thinking about how I can learn more about the world and how I can share my knowledge with others. You should definitely check my about me for more though!
