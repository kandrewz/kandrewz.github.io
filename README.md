### About me

<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm Andrew Kan (pronounced Can). I am a third-year Computer Science and Engineering major and Statistics minor student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I'm currently thinking about how I can learn more about the world and how I can share this with others. You should definitely check my about me for more though!
